# YouTubeAutomationWeb
The goal of this project is to build on top of Selenium WebDriver and libraries to provide a structured com.google.android.youtube.com.google.youtube.automation.test
        framework for testing the YouTube Android and iOS apps in a maintainable manner. The goal is to provide the
        project structures and tools to help QA professionals quickly setup and develop acceptance level mobile tests
        which are configurable, robust, and easy to use.
